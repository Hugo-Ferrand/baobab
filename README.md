BAO-n-B is a website made in 1 week by a team of 4 students of Le Wagon, Nantes.
The goal was to create our first marketplace.
This web app was generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates) with the framework Ruby on Rails.
Thanks to this website, you can book a baboab or rent your own baobab ! 
To create this app, we used Ruby, HTML, CSS Simple form, bootstrap, Cloudinary, Heroku and the mapbox API.
